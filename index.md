# Call for Participation

How can we design novel financial technologies (fintech) to better support social relationships and norms? Collaborative financial activities and decision-making are highly common in our daily activities. However, existing fintech has mostly considered finance as an individual phenomenon. This CHI 2025 workshop on “Future of Money and HCI” will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers interested in reshaping the current landscape of digital money and fintech with a focus on social and collaborative interactions. Specifically, we will identify limitations of existing fintech approaches and potential strategies to address these limitations. We will also discuss key challenges for fintech design and development, including collaboration, privacy, agency, trust, and accessibility. The workshop will lead to identifying novel HCI research and implementation directions focusing on the future of financial technologies. Authors are encouraged to submit position papers relevant to the workshop theme. Relevant topics include (but not limited to) the design of fintech interactions, unique use cases for social financial interactions, ethical considerations in fintech design, and designing supportive collaboration for marginalized communities. Submissions should use the ACM Master Article Submission Templates (single column; up to 4 pages excluding references). Papers should be submitted via EasyChair. We will select submissions based on quality and suitability for the workshop topic. Submissions are semi-archival. Accepted papers will be featured on the workshop website. At least one author must attend the workshop, in-person or remotely.
