# Call for Participation


How can we design novel financial technologies (fintech) to better support social relationships and norms? Collaborative financial activities and decision-making are highly common in our daily activities. However, existing fintech has mostly considered finance as an individual phenomenon. This CHI 2025 workshop on the “Future of Money and HCI” will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers interested in reshaping the current landscape of digital money and fintech with a focus on social and collaborative interactions. Specifically, we will identify limitations of existing fintech approaches and potential strategies to address these limitations. We will also discuss key challenges for fintech design and development, including collaboration, privacy, agency, trust, and accessibility. The workshop will lead to identifying novel HCI research and implementation directions focusing on the future of financial technologies.

Authors are encouraged to submit position papers relevant to the workshop theme. Relevant topics include (but not limited to) the design of fintech interactions, unique use cases for social financial interactions, ethical considerations in fintech design, and designing supportive collaboration for marginalized communities.

# Workshop Themes

The workshop will focus on both identifying challenges and opportunities to address these challenges related to the following topics:

- How can we leverage novel data sources or methodologies to enable social interaction or promote financial collaboration?
- What user groups or financial scenarios can be better supported by more social fintech capabilities?
- How can we design and deploy collaborative financial interventions?
- How can we leverage existing social support systems for shared decision-making and long term financial stability?
- How can we make fintech more inclusive and accessible to increase support opportunities?
- How can we increase personalization to accommodate a wider range of financial goals?
- How can we provide collaborative support options within fintech systems?
- How can we design fintech that is mindful of marginalized or stigmatized populations?
- How can design privacy-preserving collaborative fintech systems?
- How can we maintain user agency in financially collaborative systems?
- How can we better protect users from financial abuse and exploitation risks?
