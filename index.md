Money and financial activities reflect social connections and societal norms Collaborative financial activities and decision-making are highly common in our day-to-day activities. However, existing financial technologies (fintech) are often limited to individual-centric approaches and goals. Recent HCI work has repeatedly noted the need for creating new interaction strategies and design paradigms to better support our financial behaviors, habits, and goals. However, there has not been much concrete work yet, specifically when it comes to supporting collaborative behaviors and social norms that underpin much of our daily financial activities. In this workshop, we will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers interested in reshaping the current landscape of digital money and fintech with a focus on social and collaborative interactions. Specifically, we will identify limitations of existing fintech approaches and potential strategies to address these limitations. We will also discuss key challenges for fintech design and development, including collaboration, privacy, agency, trust, and accessibility. The workshop will lead to identifying novel HCI research and implementation directions focusing on the future of financial technologies.

# Call for Participation

This workshop will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers interested in digital money and fintech with a focus on social and collaborative interactions. Specifically, we will identify limitations of existing fintech approaches and potential strategies to address these limitations. We will also discuss key challenges for fintech design and development, including collaboration, privacy, agency, trust, and accessibility. The workshop will lead to identifying novel HCI research and implementation directions focusing on the future of financial technologies.


We call for position papers and short empirical, theoretical or methodological papers inspired by (but not limited to) the challenges and opportunities related to the following topics:

- How can we leverage novel data sources or methodologies to enable social interaction or promote financial collaboration?
- What user groups or financial scenarios can be better supported by more social fintech capabilities?
- How can we design and deploy collaborative financial interventions?
- How can we leverage existing social support systems for shared decision-making and long term financial stability?
- How can we make fintech more inclusive and accessible to increase support opportunities?
- How can we increase personalization to accommodate a wider range of financial goals?
- How can we provide collaborative support options within fintech systems?
- How can we design fintech that is mindful of marginalized or stigmatized populations?
- How can design privacy-preserving collaborative fintech systems?
- How can we maintain user agency in financially collaborative systems?
- How can we better protect users from financial abuse and exploitation risks? 

We also welcome reflections, argumentation, and case studies related to designing fintech, or broader ethical issues related to this theme.
