# Call for Participation

Money is inherently social. Collaborative financial activities and decision-making are highly common in our day-to-day activities. However, existing financial technologies have mostly considered finance as an individual activity. Recent HCI work has repeatedly noted the need for creating new interaction strategies and design paradigms to reshape the current landscape of digital money and fintech. However, there has not been much concrete work yet, specifically when it comes to supporting diverse financial goals and leveraging social connections for financial wellbeing. In this workshop, we aim to bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers interested in the future of fintech that can better support user wellbeing. Specifically, we will discuss key issues such as privacy, agency, trust, and accessibility for the development of new financial technologies. The workshop will focus on sharing common knowledge, identifying new opportunities for fintech, and supporting a community of HCI researchers focused on financial wellbeing.
